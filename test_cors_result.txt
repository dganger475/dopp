No output was returned from the Python requests test. This suggests either:
- The test server is not running or not reachable on port 5001
- The OPTIONS request is being handled but not returning a body
- There may be an error in the test_cors_fix.py script or in the server startup

Next step: Check if the test server is running and listening on port 5001, and add explicit logging and a body to the OPTIONS response.

Update test_cors_fix.py to ensure the OPTIONS handler returns a visible response body and log to the console on every request.
