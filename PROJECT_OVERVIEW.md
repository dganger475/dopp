# DoppleGänger Web Application - Project Overview

## Purpose

The DoppleGänger Web Application is designed to provide a platform for users to manage their profiles, interact socially, and potentially utilize features related to image and face processing (based on the presence of routes like `/face` and `/image`). The core idea seems to revolve around user profiles, social interactions (feed, likes, comments), and handling images, possibly for comparison or display.

## Current Functionality

As of the current state, the application includes the following major areas:

- **User Authentication:** Login and potentially registration and session management (handled by Flask-Login).
- **Core Application Setup:** Configuration loading, extension initialization (like Caching, CORS, Limiter, Talisman), logging, and error handling.
- **Modular Routes:** The application is structured with blueprints for different features like authentication, main pages, direct views, profiles, reactions, social features, search, comparisons, notifications, and API endpoints (both standard and mobile).
- **Image Handling:** Routes exist for serving images (`/image`), specifically direct match images.
- **Face Handling:** Routes exist for serving face images by ID and a simple face viewer (`/face`).
- **Modular Social Structure:** The large `social.py` file has been successfully broken down into smaller, more manageable modules within the `routes/social/` directory (`__init__.py`, `feed.py`, `interactions.py`, `friends.py`, `notifications.py`). The original `routes/social.py` has been cleaned up and now primarily serves to register the main social blueprint and its sub-blueprints.
- **Health Check:** An endpoint (`/health`) is available for monitoring application status, including database and cache connectivity.
- **Request Timing:** Middleware is implemented to log the duration of requests for performance monitoring.

## Current State of Development & Audit Progress

The project is currently undergoing a significant code audit and refactoring process. The primary goals are to improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability.

- **`app.py` Refactoring:** `app.py` has been reviewed and is being streamlined to focus solely on application initialization, configuration loading, and blueprint registration. Routes and business logic are being moved to dedicated blueprint modules.
- **Modularization:** Key areas like core utilities (`routes/core.py`), face-related functionality (`routes/face.py`), image handling (`routes/image.py`), and social features (`routes/social/`) have been extracted into their own files and registered as blueprints.
- **Social Module Restructuring:** This phase is largely complete. The original monolithic `social.py` has been successfully refactored into a modular structure with dedicated files for feed, interactions, and friends. The old file has been cleaned up.
- **TODOs and Implementation Gaps:** The newly created modular files contain placeholder functions marked with `TODO` comments, indicating areas where the actual logic (e.g., database interactions) needs to be implemented or verified.
- **Import and Linter Error Review:** The next immediate step is to review the imports in the new modular files and fix any linter errors that may have been introduced during the refactoring.
- **Overall Development:** The focus is currently on establishing a clean and organized backend structure. Frontend development and full feature implementation depend on the successful completion of this backend refactoring.

## Future Development Plans

Based on the existing structure and common web application patterns, potential future development areas include:

- **Complete Social Features:** Fully implement all social functionalities (posting, liking, commenting, sharing, following, user profiles, news feed) using the new modular structure and integrating with the database.
- **Enhanced Search:** Improve the search capabilities, possibly including more advanced filtering, sorting, and different search types.
- **Advanced Image/Face Processing:** Implement or integrate with libraries for more sophisticated face comparison, recognition, or image manipulation features.
- **Notifications System:** Build out a robust notification system for user interactions and other application events.
- **API Expansion:** Develop and refine the API endpoints for potential mobile application integration or external services.
- **Improved UI/UX:** Enhance the frontend user interface and user experience.
- **Database Optimization:** Optimize database schemas and queries for performance and scalability.
- **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Define and refine the deployment process for different environments (development, staging, production).

## Current State Summary

The project has made significant progress in refactoring the backend structure, particularly the social module. The focus is now on verifying the correctness of the moved code, resolving any errors or inconsistencies, and implementing the remaining logic (marked with TODOs) to ensure the application functions as expected with the new modular design.
